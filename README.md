    <span>Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical disease caused by the
    <em>Leishmania</em> parasite transmitted by the bite of the female infected
    phlebotomine sandfly. It affects the skin and is characterized by painless
    or pruritus long-lasting lesions which are complicated through secondary
    bacterial infection. However, there is limited information on studying the
    normal/healthy skin flora in comparison to the flora of CL-infected skin.
    This cross-sectional study, therefore, sought to investigate the bacterial
    diversity on both skins. We suspected that CL infection alters the normal
    skin flora, which could have implications on the immune response and the
    infection outcome. We administered structured questionnaires to obtain the
    sociodemographic and clinical information of participants. Skin swabs of
    healthy individuals and CL-infected patients were cultured on selective and
    differential agar. We then examined bacterial morphology using oil immersion
    microscopy and examined their enzymatic reactions through a series of
    biochemical tests. Next, we identified bacteria using MALDI TOF Mass
    Spectrometry for comparison. Our bioinformatic analysis revealed a striking
    contrast between the healthy and CL-infected skin informing the impact of
    the disease on the immune system owing to different bacterial species
    identified which are mostly pathogenic on the CL-infected skin. Hostsâ€™
    intrinsic/extrinsic factors noted to affect diversity were next tested which
    revealed information on how best to preserve the normal flora. Our findings
    present data which would help medicine and microbiology to develop better
    therapies to restore the CL skin to normalcy.</span>
